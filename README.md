to manage your photos, videos, sound recordings, e-books and e-documents in a simple way

## Goals

>- Avoid overfilling folders

## Tips
>- Organize documents by dates
>- Use "Tickler" files
### Tickler files, also known as the "43 folders" method, are a unique system that's used by many people for organizing files. Create 12 folders (one for each month of the year) and an additional 31 subfolders (for each day of the month). Fill each folder with the documents that you need to work with on that day. At the beginning of each day, open the folder for that day. Take all the items out of the folder and move them into a "today" folder or onto your desktop. Then move the empty folder into the corresponding slot for the next month. If you can't complete some work items by the end of the day, transfer them to the folder for the next convenient day. This system of file management helps you keep track of everything you need to do, and it also doubles as a diary.

## Key Points

>- Spending precious time looking for documents can take the pleasure out of any kind of creative work you might be doing â€“ and it adds to your stress levels as well. Simple good file management habits can hugely simplify your working life!
